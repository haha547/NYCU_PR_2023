## Homework Policy
For the first three assignments, **only NumPy is allowed** — the use of high-level machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch is strictly prohibited.

## HW1: Linear Regression
- Implement simple linear regression with a **single feature**.
- Extend the implementation to **multiple features** for multivariate regression.
- Apply **One-Hot Encoding** to handle categorical input variables.

## HW2: Logistic Regression & Fisher’s Linear Discriminant
- Implement **multiclass logistic regression** using the one-vs-rest strategy.
- Develop **Fisher’s Linear Discriminant** for dimensionality reduction and classification tasks.

## HW3: Decision Tree & Random Forest
- Implement a **decision tree classifier** from scratch.
- Explore impurity measures including **Entropy** and **Gini Index**.
- Extend the model to a **random forest** by combining multiple decision trees with bootstrap sampling and feature bagging.

## HW4: Model Selection with K-Fold Cross-Validation & Grid Search
- Perform **hyperparameter tuning** using **grid search**.
- Evaluate model performance using **K-fold cross-validation**.
- Apply these techniques to optimize a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier.

## Final Project: CAPTCHA Recognition
- Build a **CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network)** to recognize alphanumeric CAPTCHA images.
- The task involves **image preprocessing**, sequence modeling, and **character-level prediction**.
